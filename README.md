# Cisco-CCNA-Journey
Repository for documenting my Cisco CCNA certification journey, featuring network topologies, packet analysis, and technical labs focused on Network Security.
CCNA Study Labs 🇮🇪
This is where I document my transition into CyberSecurity. I’m currently focusing on the Cisco CCNA curriculum to build a strong networking foundation before moving back to TryHackMe and SOC analysis.

What's inside:
Labs: Packet Tracer files from my eCollege course.

Troubleshooting: Notes on why things break and how I fixed them.

Security: How network protocols (OSI Model) relate to defense.

Current Progress:
Status: Week 2 - Deep dive into the Transport Layer.

Latest Lab: Differences between TCP and UDP in real traffic.
